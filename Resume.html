    <p>This project, individuals and organizations with constrained storage resources can
        seamlessly delegate to servers. These servers, in exchange for compensation,
        ensure the perpetual accessibility clientâ€™s information. Through the utilization of
        some protocols, clients can validate the integrity of their offloaded data. This
        undertaking investigates the feasibility of establishing tailored data scenarios. This
        pursuit involves harnessing the methodologies inherent in network coding
        algorithms.</p><hr>
        <h3>CHATBOT:</h3><p>A CHATBOT is an artificial person, animal or other creature which holds conversations
            with humans. This could be a text based (typed) conversation, a spoken conversationor
            even a non-verbal conversation. Chat bot can run on local computers and phones, thoughmost of the time it is accessed through the internet. Chat bot is typically perceivedas
            engaging software entity which humans can talk to. It can be interesting, inspiring andintriguing. It appears everywhere, from old ancient HTML pages to modern advancedsocial networking</p><hr>
        <h3>Speech Recognition</h3><p>Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), is a technology that
            converts spoken language into written text. It involves the use of algorithms and machine
            learning techniques to analyze and interpret audio input in order to transcribe it into textual
            output. Speech recognition has a wide range of applications, including virtual assistants,
            transcription services, customer service call centers, voice-controlled systems, and many
            more.</p></td>
